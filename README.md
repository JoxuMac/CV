# CV

The CV is an important part of yourself. It has to reflect your experience, your knowledge, your habilities and skills. 
It is your presentation letter, you have to be able to define yourself in just 30 seconds, and a good CV is the best way to do it.

Here is my CV in latex format, in [English](https://github.com/JoxuMac/CV/blob/master/English/CV.pdf) and also in [Spanish](https://github.com/JoxuMac/CV/blob/master/Castellano/CV.pdf)
